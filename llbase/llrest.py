    Implements a simple wrapper for calling a REST interface that returns
    either llsd or json, with optional authentication.

    Any error in the HTTP request or parsing the response raises a RESTError,
    whose value describes the requested url and the error.

    Instantiate a RESTService for each service you need to use,
    and then use the get method on that service instance to execute requests.

    authenticated:   a boolean: whether or not the service expects HTTP authentication (see get_credentials)
    username:        the username to be used for HTTP authentication
    password:        the password to be used for HTTP authentication
    proxy_hostport:  an HTTP proxy hostname and port number (host:port) through which requests should be routed
