    Class for loading llsd files as configuration.

    Config loads an llsd file and into memory and provides a pythonic
    interface into that data. Typically, the llsd file wil be a map
    with simple key-value pairs. The value can be anything supported
    by llsd including another map with new childern. This
    representation in memory can get updated to overwrite values or
    add new values.

    The xml configuration file is considered a live file and changes
    to the file are checked and reloaded periodically. If a value had
    been overwritten via the update or set method, the loaded values
    from the file are ignored (the values from the update/set methods
    override)

    The config is implemented as 2 sets of configuration -- one comes
    from the file and the other is whatever has been set during
    runtime. When a key is set during runtime it is treated as a
    runtime override over the file config even if the file is updated.
